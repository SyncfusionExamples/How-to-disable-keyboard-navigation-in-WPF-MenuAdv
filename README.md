# How-to-disable-keyboard-navigation-in-WPF-MenuAdv
This repository provides a detailed example of how to disable keyboard navigation in the **WPF [MenuAdv](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/menu/getting-started)** control, which is part of the Syncfusion WPF suite. By default, MenuAdv allows users to navigate through menu items using keyboard keys such as **Arrow keys, Tab, and Enter.** However, in certain scenarios, you may want to restrict this behavior to ensure that navigation occurs only through mouse interaction or custom logic.

Disabling keyboard navigation can be useful in applications where keyboard shortcuts are reserved for other operations or when you want to maintain a specific user experience. This sample demonstrates how to override the default behavior by handling key events and preventing focus changes between menu items.

For complete implementation details and code snippets, refer to the official Syncfusion KB article:

This guide walks you through customizing the control behavior using event handlers and properties.
